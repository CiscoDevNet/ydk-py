""" openconfig_segment_routing 

Configuration and operational state parameters relating to the
segment routing. This module defines a number of elements which are
instantiated in multiple places throughout the OpenConfig collection
of models.

Particularly\:
 \- SRGB+LB dataplane instances \- directly instantied by SR.
 \- SRGB+LB dataplane reservations \- instantiated within MPLS and future SR
                                 dataplanes.
 \- SR SID advertisements \- instantiated within the relevant IGP.
 \- SR\-specific counters \- instantied within the relevant dataplane.
