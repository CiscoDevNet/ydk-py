""" INET_ADDRESS_MIB 

This MIB module defines textual conventions for
representing Internet addresses.  An Internet
address can be an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address,
or a DNS domain name.  This module also defines
textual conventions for Internet port numbers,
autonomous system numbers, and the length of an
Internet address prefix.

Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2005).  This version
of this MIB module is part of RFC 4001, see the RFC
itself for full legal notices.

    InetAddressType (Enum Class)

    A value that represents a type of Internet address.

    unknown(0)  An unknown address type.  This value MUST

                be used if the value of the corresponding

                InetAddress object is a zero\-length string.

                It may also be used to indicate an IP address

                that is not in one of the formats defined

                below.

    ipv4(1)     An IPv4 address as defined by the

                InetAddressIPv4 textual convention.

    ipv6(2)     An IPv6 address as defined by the

                InetAddressIPv6 textual convention.

    ipv4z(3)    A non\-global IPv4 address including a zone

                index as defined by the InetAddressIPv4z

                textual convention.

    ipv6z(4)    A non\-global IPv6 address including a zone

                index as defined by the InetAddressIPv6z

                textual convention.

    dns(16)     A DNS domain name as defined by the

                InetAddressDNS textual convention.

    Each definition of a concrete InetAddressType value must be

    accompanied by a definition of a textual convention for use

    with that InetAddressType.

    To support future extensions, the InetAddressType textual

    convention SHOULD NOT be sub\-typed in object type definitions.

    It MAY be sub\-typed in compliance statements in order to

    require only a subset of these address types for a compliant

    implementation.

    Implementations must ensure that InetAddressType objects

    and any dependent objects (e.g., InetAddress objects) are

    consistent.  An inconsistentValue error must be generated

    if an attempt to change an InetAddressType object would,

    for example, lead to an undefined InetAddress value.  In

    particular, InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs must be

    changed together if the address type changes (e.g., from

    ipv6(2) to ipv4(1)).
