class PhysicalClass(Enum):
    """
    PhysicalClass (Enum Class)

    An enumerated value which provides an indication of the

    general hardware type of a particular physical entity.

    There are no restrictions as to the number of

    entPhysicalEntries of each entPhysicalClass, which must be

    instantiated by an agent.

    The enumeration 'other' is applicable if the physical entity

    class is known, but does not match any of the supported

    values.

    The enumeration 'unknown' is applicable if the physical

    entity class is unknown to the agent.

    The enumeration 'chassis' is applicable if the physical

    entity class is an overall container for networking

    equipment.  Any class of physical entity, except a stack,

    may be contained within a chassis; and a chassis may only

    be contained within a stack.

    The enumeration 'backplane' is applicable if the physical

    entity class is some sort of device for aggregating and

    forwarding networking traffic, such as a shared backplane in

    a modular ethernet switch.  Note that an agent may model a

    backplane as a single physical entity, which is actually

    implemented as multiple discrete physical components (within

    a chassis or stack).

    The enumeration 'container' is applicable if the physical

    entity class is capable of containing one or more removable

    physical entities, possibly of different types.  For

    example, each (empty or full) slot in a chassis will be

    modeled as a container.  Note that all removable physical

    entities should be modeled within a container entity, such

    as field\-replaceable modules, fans, or power supplies.  Note

    that all known containers should be modeled by the agent,

    including empty containers.

    The enumeration 'powerSupply' is applicable if the physical

    entity class is a power\-supplying component.

    The enumeration 'fan' is applicable if the physical entity

    class is a fan or other heat\-reduction component.

    The enumeration 'sensor' is applicable if the physical

    entity class is some sort of sensor, such as a temperature

    sensor within a router chassis.

    The enumeration 'module' is applicable if the physical

    entity class is some sort of self\-contained sub\-system.  If

    the enumeration 'module' is removable, then it should be

    modeled within a container entity, otherwise it should be

    modeled directly within another physical entity (e.g., a

    chassis or another module).

    The enumeration 'port' is applicable if the physical entity

    class is some sort of networking port, capable of receiving

    and/or transmitting networking traffic.

    The enumeration 'stack' is applicable if the physical entity

    class is some sort of super\-container (possibly virtual),

    intended to group together multiple chassis entities.  A

    stack may be realized by a 'virtual' cable, a real

    interconnect cable, attached to multiple chassis, or may in

    fact be comprised of multiple interconnect cables.  A stack

    should not be modeled within any other physical entities,

    but a stack may be contained within another stack.  Only

    chassis entities should be contained within a stack.

    The enumeration 'cpu' is applicable if the physical entity

    class is some sort of central processing unit.

For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular module, and all ports on that module are ports on this bridge.  A mapping between the bridge and the module would be useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and each of the ports on that module would be redundant (because the entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same information).  On the other hand, if more than one bridge were utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate.

            	An indication of the relative position of this 'child' component among all its 'sibling' components.  Sibling components are defined as entPhysicalEntries that share the same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalClass objects.  An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering for all sibling components of a particular parent (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each sibling entry).  If possible, this value should match any external labeling of the physical component.  For example, for a container (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3', entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'.  Note that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3 should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'.  If the physical position of this component does not match any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then user documentation or other external reference material should be used to determine the parent\-relative position. If this is not possible, then the agent should assign a consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal representation of the components.   If the agent cannot determine the parent\-relative position for some reason, or if the associated value of entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '\-1' is returned.  Otherwise, a non\-negative integer is returned, indicating the parent\-relative position of this physical entity.  Parent\-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest positioned child entity.  However, if the physical entities (e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero, then the first sibling should be associated with an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'.  Note that this ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent implementation.  The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as each 'parent' component may use different numbering algorithms.  The ordering is only meaningful among siblings of the same parent component.  The agent should retain parent\-relative position values across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use of non\-volatile storage

This might be a text name (e.g., `console') or a simple component number (e.g., port or module number, such as `1'), depending on the physical component naming syntax of the device.  If there is no local name, or if this object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a zero\-length string.

            	The vendor\-specific serial number string for the physical entity.  The preferred value is the serial number string actually printed on the component itself (if present).  On the first instantiation of an physical entity, the value of entPhysicalSerialNum associated with that entity is set to the correct vendor\-assigned serial number, if this information is available to the agent.  If a serial number is unknown or non\-existent, the entPhysicalSerialNum will be set to a zero\-length string instead.  Note that implementations that can correctly identify the serial numbers of all installed physical entities do not need to provide write access to the entPhysicalSerialNum object.  Agents which cannot provide non\-volatile storage for the entPhysicalSerialNum strings are not required to implement write access for this object.  Not every physical component will have a serial number, or even need one.  Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module), do not need their own unique serial number.  An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities, and may return a zero\-length string.  If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalSerialNum, and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalSerialNum instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated.  This includes instantiations across all re\-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical   entity's entPhysicalIndex value

Not every physical component will have an asset tracking identifier, or even need one.  Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module), do not need their own unique asset tracking identifier.

The first serial number string of the physical entity is represented in the value of corresponding  instance of the 'entPhysicalSerialNum' object.  On the first instantiation of an physical entity, the value of this object is the correct vendor\-assigned second  serial number, if this information is available to the agent.   If the second serial number is unknown or non\-existent, then  the value of this object will be a zero\-length string instead.  Note that implementations which can correctly identify the second serial numbers of all installed physical entities do  not need to provide write access to this object.  Agents which cannot provide non\-volatile storage for the  second serial number strings are not required to implement  write access for this object.  Not every physical component will have a serial number, or even need one.  Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module), do not need their own unique serial number.

This is possible when the logical entities, represented by the same value of entLogicalCommunity, have no object instances in common.  For example, 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' may be part of the main naming scope, but at least one additional community string is needed to represent 'bridge2' and 'repeater2'.

        This table contains zero or more rows of logical entity to
        physical equipment associations.  For each logical entity
        known by this agent, there are zero or more mappings to the
        physical resources, which are used to realize that logical
        entity.
        
        An agent should limit the number and nature of entries in
        this table such that only meaningful and non\-redundant
        information is returned.  For example, in a system that
        contains a single power supply, mappings between logical
        entities and the power supply are not useful and should not
        be included.
        
        Also, only the most appropriate physical component, which is
        closest to the root of a particular containment tree, should
        be identified in an entLPMapping entry.
        
        For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular
        module, and all ports on that module are ports on this
        bridge.  A mapping between the bridge and the module would
        be useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and
        each of the ports on that module would be redundant (because
        the entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same
        information).  On the other hand, if more than one bridge
        were utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between
        each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate.
        
        Also, in the case of a single backplane repeater, a mapping
        for the backplane to the single repeater entity is not
        necessary.
