            The implementation of the MIB module using this textual

            convention does not recognize the type of target.

        'interface'

            The target is a physical, logical, or virtual interface

            represented by an ifEntry (defined by the IF\-MIB).

    An implementation must ensure that DynamicTemplateTargetType

    object and any associated DynamicTemplateTargetId objects are

    consistent.  An attempt to set a DynamicTemplateTargetType

    object to a value inconsistent with the associated

    DynamicTemplateTargetId object must result in a response with

    an

    error\-status of 'inconsistentValue'.

    DynamicTemplateType (Enum Class)

    template\:

    'other'

        The implementation of the MIB module using this textual

        convention does not recognize the type of dynamic template.

    'derived'

        A configuration resulting from the union of the attributes

        contained by all the dynamic templates associated with a

        target.  The system generates a derived configuration, and

        an EMS/NMS cannot directly modify it.  An EMS/NMS can only

        affect a derived configuration by modifying one or more of

        the dynamic templates associated with the target.

    'ppp'

        A PPP template is a set of locally\-configured attributes

        relating to the configuration of a PPP interface.

    'ethernet'

        An Ethernet template is a set of locally\-configured

        attributes used by the system to configure dynamic

        interfaces initiated on Ethernet virtual interfaces (e.g.,

        EoMPLS) or automatically created VLANs.

    'ipSubscriber'

        An IP subscriber template is a set of locally\-configured

        attributes used by the system to configure certain types of

        IP and L2 subscriber sessions.

    'service'

        A service template is a set of locally\-configured attributes

        used by the system to configure subscriber sessions.  These

        attributes specifically relate to services, and the system

        applies these attributes in response to subscriber session

        life\-cycle events.
