    subset of these address types for a compliant

    implementation.

    objects and any dependent objects

    (e.g., TeHopAddress objects) are consistent.

    An inconsistentValue error must be generated

    if an attempt to change a TeHopAddressType

    object would, for example, lead to an

    undefined TeHopAddress value that is

    not defined herein.  In particular,
