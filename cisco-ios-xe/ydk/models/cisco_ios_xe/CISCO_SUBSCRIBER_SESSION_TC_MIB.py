class SubSessionType(Enum):
    """
    SubSessionType (Enum Class)

    An enumerated integer\-value describing the type of subscriber

    session.  This value has the intent of refining the interface

    type assigned to a subscriber session.  The interface type

    assigned to a subscriber session groups those types of

    subscriber sessions with similar interface semantics.

    A PPP subscriber session consists of a PPP connection

    (RFC\-1661)

    and has an interface type of 'ppp'.  The following subscriber

    types refine PPP subscriber sessions\:

        'pppSubscriber'

            A PPP connection initiated over a circuit (e.g., an

    ISDN

            line or ATM VC) using the LCP (RFC\-1661).

        'pppoeSubscriber'

            A PPP connection over Ethernet (RFC\-2516), initiated

            by a PADI (PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation) packet.

        'l2tpSubscriber'

            A PPP connection over an L2TP tunnel (RFC\-2661),

            initiated by an Incoming\-Call\-Request control message.

        'l2fSubscriber'

            A PPP connection over an L2F tunnel (RFC\-2341),

            initiated by a L2F\_OPEN message with a non\-zero MID.

    An IP subscriber session consists of the routed traffic

    associated with a subscriber IP address having an interface

    type of 'ipSubscriber'.  Routed traffic describes IP traffic

    that transits at least one router.  If a subscriber's IP

    address

    is not unique to the system, further distinguishing

    characteristics, such as VRF or MAC address, form part of the

    subscriber's identity.  The following subscriber types refine

    IP

    subscriber sessions\:

        'ipInterfaceSubscriber'

            An IP subcriber session provisioned by the system's

            configuration which consists of all traffic received by

            the interface to which the provisioning applies.

        'ipPktSubscriber'

            An IP subscriber session initiated by the receipt of

    the

            first packet received with an unclassified source IP

            address.

        'ipDhcpv4Subscriber'

            An IP subscriber session initiated by the receipt of a

            DHCPv4 DISCOVER packet (RFC\-2131).

        'ipRadiusSubscriber'

            An IP subscriber session initiated by the receipt of a

            RADIUS Access\-Request packet (RFC\-2865).

    An L2 subscriber session consists of the non\-routed traffic

    associated with a subscriber IP address having an interface

    type of 'l2Subscriber'.  Non\-routed traffic describes IP

    traffic

    that doesn't transit a router, meaning that the subscriber must

    be directly connected to the system or have a connection

    through

    an L2 access network (e.g., bridges, switches, and tunnels).

    The

    following subscriber types refine L2 subscriber sessions\:

        'l2MacPacketSubscriber'

            An L2 subscriber session initiated by the receipt of

    the

            first layer 2 packet with an unclassified source MAC

            address.

        'l2Dhcpv4Subscriber'

            An L2 subscriber session initiated by the receipt of a

            DHCPv4 DISCOVER packet (RFC\-2131).

        'l2RadiusSucriber'

            An L2 subscriber session initiated by the receipt of a

            RADIUS Access\-Request packet (RFC\-2865).

    The system should assign the value 'other' to any subscriber

    session not recognized by the implementation of a MIB module

    using this textual convention.

    The value 'all' represents a special value used to indicate all

    subscriber session types.  For example, a scope of aggregation

    that includes all subscriber session types uses this value to

    indicate this fact.
