""" CISCO_VLAN_MEMBERSHIP_MIB 

The MIB module for the management of the VLAN
Membership within the frame  work of Cisco
VLAN Architecture, v 2.0 by Keith McCloghrie. The MIB
provides information on VLAN Membership Policy Servers
used by a device and VLAN membership assignments of
non\-trunk bridge ports of the device.
