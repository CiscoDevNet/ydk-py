""" CISCO_DOT3_OAM_MIB 

The MIB module for managing the new Ethernet OAM features
introduced by the Ethernet in the First Mile task force (IEEE
802.3ah).  The functionality presented here is based on IEEE
802.3ah [802.3ah], released in October, 2004.  [802.3ah] was
prepared as an addendum to the standing version of IEEE 802.3
[802.3\-2002] at the time.  Since then, [802.3ah] has been
merged into the base IEEE 802.3 specification in [802.3\-2005].

In particular, this MIB focuses on the new OAM functions
introduced in Clause 57 of [802.3ah].  The OAM functionality
of Clause 57 is controlled by new management attributes
introduced in Clause 30 of [802.3ah].  The OAM functions are
not specific to any particular Ethernet physical layer, and
can be generically applied to any Ethernet interface of
[802.3\-2002].  

An Ethernet OAM protocol data unit is a valid Ethernet frame
with a destination MAC address equal to the reserved MAC
address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), a
lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow
Protocols, and a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the
subtype reserved for Ethernet OAM.  OAMPDU is used throughout
this document as an abbreviation for Ethernet OAM protocol
data unit.

Loopback can be used to place the remote OAM entity in a state where every received frame (except OAMPDUs) is echoed back over the same interface on which they were received.   In this state, at the remote entity, 'normal' traffic is disabled as only the looped back frames are transmitted on the interface. Loopback is thus an intrusive operation that prohibits normal data flow and should be used accordingly.

Ethernet OAM events can be signaled by Event Notification OAMPDUs or by the flags field in any OAMPDU.    This table contains both threshold crossing events and non\-threshold crossing events.  The parameters for the threshold window, threshold value, and actual value (cdot3OamEventLogWindowXX, cdot3OamEventLogThresholdXX, cdot3OamEventLogValue) are only applicable to threshold crossing events, and are returned as all F's (2^32 \- 1) for non\-threshold crossing events.

            	At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on the same full\-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link.  The progress of this initialization is controlled by the OAM sublayer.               This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this interface via the cdot3OamAdminState.    If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2). Also, if the interface is not operational (ifOperStatus is not  up(1)), linkFault(2) is returned.  Note that the object  ifOperStatus may not be up(1) as a result of link failure or administrative action (ifAdminState being down(2) or testing(3)).                     The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in passive mode (cdot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OAM capable.  The activeSendLocal(4) value is used by active mode devices (cdot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has not yet made that determination.                     The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OAM entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or rejected the configuration of the peer.  The local device can, for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is unacceptable and decline OAM peering.  If the local OAM entity rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7).  If the OAM peering is allowed by the local device, the state moves to sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6).  Note that both the sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states fall within the state SEND\_LOCAL\_REMOTE of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57\-5], with the difference being whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering or has just not indicated any decision yet.  Whether a peering decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.10).    If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8).  Note that both the sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8) states fall within the state SEND\_LOCAL\_REMOTE\_OK of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57\-5], with the difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected the peering or has just not yet decided.  This is indicated via the remote flags field in the OAM PDU (reflected in the aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11).                     When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to operational(9) corresponding to the SEND\_ANY state of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57\-5].    Since Ethernet OAM functions are not designed to work completely over half\-duplex interfaces, the value nonOperHalfDuplex(10) is returned whenever Ethernet OAM is enabled (cdot3OamAdminState is enabled(1)) but the interface is in half\-duplex operation.

These two modes differ in that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OAM actions with it.  As an example, an active OAM entity can put the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OAM entity cannot.    The default value of cdot3OamMode is dependent on the type of system on which this Ethernet like interface resides.  The default value should be 'active(1)' unless it is known that this system should take on a subservient role to the other device connected over this interface.    Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration revision field of locally generated OAMPDUs (30.3.6.1.12) and potentially re\-doing the OAM discovery process if the cdot3OamOperStatus was already operational(9).

                This object configures the mode of OAM operation for this

                Ethernet like interface.  OAM on Ethernet interfaces may be in

                'active' mode or 'passive' mode.  These two modes differ in

                that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate

                monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while

                passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OAM

                actions with it.  As an example, an active OAM entity can put

                the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OAM

                entity cannot.  

                The default value of cdot3OamMode is dependent on the type of

                system on which this Ethernet like interface resides.  The

                default value should be 'active(1)' unless it is known that

                this system should take on a subservient role to the other

                device connected over this interface.  

                Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration

                revision field of locally generated OAMPDUs (30.3.6.1.12) and

                At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on

                the same full\-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to

                determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link.  The

                progress of this initialization is controlled by the OAM

                sublayer.  

                This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this

                interface via the cdot3OamAdminState.  

                If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs

                with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2). Also,

                if the interface is not operational (ifOperStatus is not 

                up(1)), linkFault(2) is returned.  Note that the object 

                ifOperStatus may not be up(1) as a result of link failure or

                administrative action (ifAdminState being down(2) or

                testing(3)).  

                The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in

                passive mode (cdot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the

                OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OAM

                capable.  The activeSendLocal(4) value is used by active mode

                devices (cdot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively

                trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has

                not yet made that determination.  

                The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OAM

                entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or

                rejected the configuration of the peer.  The local device can,

                for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is

                unacceptable and decline OAM peering.  If the local OAM entity

                rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes

                oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7).  If the OAM peering is allowed

                by the local device, the state moves to

                sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6).  Note that both the

                sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states

                fall within the state SEND\_LOCAL\_REMOTE of the Discovery state

                diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57\-5], with the difference being

                whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering

                or has just not indicated any decision yet.  Whether a peering

                decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field

                in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of

                30.3.6.1.10).  

                If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state

                becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8).  Note that both the

                sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8)

                states fall within the state SEND\_LOCAL\_REMOTE\_OK of the

                Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57\-5], with the

                difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected

                the peering or has just not yet decided.  This is indicated

                via the remote flags field in the OAM PDU (reflected in the

                aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11).  

                When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote

                OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to

                operational(9) corresponding to the SEND\_ANY state of the

                Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57\-5].

        Ethernet OAM includes the ability to generate and receive
        Event Notification OAMPDUs to indicate various link problems.
        This table contains the mechanisms to enable Event
        Notifications and configure the thresholds to generate the
        standard Ethernet OAM events.  There is one entry in the table
        for every entry in cdot3OamTable that supports OAM events
        (where cdot3OamFunctionsSupported includes the eventSupport
        bit set). The values in the table are maintained across
        changes to cdot3OamOperStatus.  
        
        The standard threshold crossing events are\:
          \- Errored Symbol Period Event.  Generated when the number of
            symbol errors exceeds a threshold within a given window 
            defined by a number of symbols (for example, 1,000 symbols
            out of 1,000,000 had errors).  
          \- Errored Frame Period Event.  Generated when the number of 
            frame errors exceeds a threshold within a given window 
            defined by a number of frames (for example, 10 frames out
            of 1000 had errors).  
          \- Errored Frame Event.  Generated when the number of frame 
            errors exceeds a threshold within a given window defined 
            by a period of time (for example, 10 frames in 1 second 
            had errors).
          \- Errored Frame Seconds Summary Event.  Generated when the 
            number of errored frame seconds exceeds a threshold within
            a given time period (for example, 10 errored frame seconds
            within the last 100 seconds).  An errored frame second is 
            defined as a 1 second interval which had >0 frame errors.  
        There are other events (dying gasp, critical events) that are
        not threshold crossing events but which can be
        enabled/disabled via this table.
