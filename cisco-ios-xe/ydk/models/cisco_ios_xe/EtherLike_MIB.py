    The Time\-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) test is
    specific to ethernet\-like interfaces of type
    10Base5 and 10Base2.  The TDR value may be
    useful in determining the approximate distance
    to a cable fault.  It is advisable to repeat
    this test to check for a consistent resulting
    TDR value, to verify that there is a fault.
    
    A TDR test returns as its result the time
    interval, measured in 10 MHz ticks or 100 nsec
    units, between the start of TDR test
    transmission and the subsequent detection of a
    collision or deassertion of carrier.  On
    successful completion of a TDR test, the result
    is stored as the value of an appropriate
    instance of an appropriate vendor specific MIB
    object, and the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of that
    instance is stored in the appropriate instance
    of the appropriate test result code object
    (thereby indicating where the result has been
    stored).
    
    This object identity has been deprecated, since
    the ifTestTable in the IF\-MIB was deprecated,
    and there is no longer a standard mechanism for
    initiating an interface test.  This left no
    standard way of using this object identity.

Ethernet\-like interfaces are typically built out of several different chips. The MIB implementor is presented with a decision of which chip to identify via this object. The implementor should identify the chip which is usually called the Medium Access Control chip. If no such chip is easily identifiable, the implementor should identify the chip which actually gathers the transmit and receive statistics and error indications. This would allow a manager station to correlate the statistics and the chip generating them, giving it the ability to take into account any known anomalies in the chip.  This object has been deprecated.  Implementation feedback indicates that it is of limited use for debugging network problems in the field, and the administrative overhead involved in maintaining a registry of chipset OIDs is not justified

For an interface operating in half\-duplex mode at 1000 Mb/s, the number of times the receiving media is non\-idle (a carrier event) for a period of time equal to or greater than slotTime, and during which there was at least one occurrence of an event that causes the PHY to indicate 'Data reception error' or 'carrier extend error' on the GMII.  For an interface operating in full\-duplex mode at 1000 Mb/s, the number of times the receiving media is non\-idle (a carrier event) for a period of time equal to or greater than minFrameSize, and during which there was at least one occurrence of an event that causes the PHY to indicate 'Data reception error' on the GMII.  For an interface operating at 10 Gb/s, the number of times the receiving media is non\-idle (a carrier event) for a period of time equal to or greater than minFrameSize, and during which there was at least one occurrence of an event that causes the PHY to indicate 'Receive Error' on the XGMII.  The count represented by an instance of this object is incremented at most once per carrier event, even if multiple symbol errors occur during the carrier event.  This count does not increment if a collision is present.  This counter does not increment when the interface is operating at 10 Mb/s.  For interfaces operating at 10 Gb/s, this counter can roll over in less than 5 minutes if it is incrementing at its maximum rate.
